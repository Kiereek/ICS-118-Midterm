					<h3>The Knight</h3>
					<p>
						The game's protagonist. He utilizes his quick speed and resourcefulness to overcome his larger opponents. His nail is sharp and piercing to all except the most armoured of foes. Within him burns a desire to pursue the Hallownest's cause of infection, yet he knows nothing about himself, not even from whence he came.

					<h3>Hornet</h3>
					<p>
						Both antagonist and eventual friend of The Knight, Hornet frequently blocks his progress. She believes he is not worthy of breaking the seals and facing the challenges within. In order to pass, he will have to defeat her in combat. Her sewing needle allows her to attack at range with ease.

					<h3>Zote</h3>
					<p>
						Encountered early in The Knight's journey, Zote sees himself as the ultimate knight: courageous, powerful, a hero. While his bravery may be unmatched, so is his foolishness. He will require rescuing at every turn, often falling prey to larger insects, entangling himself in traps, and generally getting in over his head.

					<h2>What is Hollow Knight?</h2>
					<p>
						Hollow Knight is a 2D game in the Metroidvania genre. You take control of a small insect known only as The Knight. The world of Hollow Knight, called Hallownest, and its inhabitants are succumbing to a strange infection stemming from the Black Egg, a sealed tomb of an ancient champion. It's your job to traverse the expansive world to break the seal and banish the infection, meeting new friends and collecting powerups along the way.
